Overlook is a hotel management application. You can add customers, search for existing or previous customers displaying information about their current or past stays with the hotel. You can book or upgrade rooms for customers, or view the occupancy for a given date with the highest occupancy. Management can look at different revenue streams and total revenue for the hotel to date.
