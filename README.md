# Overlook 

Overlook is a hotel management application. You can add customers, search for existing or previous customers displaying information about their current or past stays with the hotel. You can book or upgrade rooms for customers, or view the occupancy for a given date with the highest occupancy. Management can look at different revenue streams and total revenue for the hotel to date.

Getting this project up ad running required using fetch and a Promise.all. I used spies to spy on dom manipulation being called in class methods. Linking the checked orders to a cart and pushing them into the local orders database was my biggest challenge. Along the same vein accessing the menu items to put the in the cart was my biggest win.

## Objectives
This Turing Mod 2 solo final project was designed for students to practice skills writing tests with Mocha and Chai, transitioning in JavaScript from ES5 to ES6 syntax while structurally utilizing OOP. We were given several datasets fromwhich we needed to accesss and manipulate data and to append to the DOM with jQuery. The project was additional practice in HTML and CSS, also transitioning to SCSS. No comp was provided.
